## TITLE
Project-1: Job Search WebPage

## DESCRIPTION
This Web-Page displays tech jobs available from various companies. Since its only tech jobs its assumed that the user is a person in the field of tech therefore, he or she chooses from fields that they feel confident in whether its frontend, fullstack, java, ruby, or backend. 
Once the user selects the field he or she is competent in, the web filters according to their selections and removes the other options from the web display.
If the user feels as if he needs to select his or her options again there is a clear navigation bar that appears on the top-right and one can click on it to start selection again.

# RUNNING
- Open the following link in your browser

- Once one is in the page on the top one can see a dummy login page, you can just put any user credentials it doesn't have to be genuine. And then click submit then the login page disappears and one is left with the Job listings options to select from.

- The User then can play around selecting different jobs they want to see as the web filters out what they select from what they dont select.
